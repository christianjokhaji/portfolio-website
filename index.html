			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Hello! My name is Christian, and I'm an up-and-coming front-end developer.</p>
			<p>I've always had an interest and fascination with computers ever since I was a young child, and always knew that I wanted to work in the field of technology.</p>
			<p>Over the course of my employment history, I have taken on various tech-related roles, including that of a: Mobile Repair Technician, Technical Support Representative, Support Team Lead, Graphic Designer, and Support Specialist. At this present time, I work as a Senior Support Specialist for Shopify Plus.</p>
			<p>With the intent of broadening my opportunities and carving out a pathway for a career in Software Engineering, I will be studying Computer Science at the University of Toronto beginning in Fall 2022.</p>
